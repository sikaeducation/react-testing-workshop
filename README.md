# Single-Page Application Development With React

## Core Ideas

These are the core abstract concepts explored in the workshop:

* One-way data flow
* Componentization
* Testing component-based apps

These three ideas are explored through many different applications. Regardless of your background, you should come out of the workshop able to speak to these three concepts at a deeper level than you can now.

## Diagnostic

Before you begin this workshop, do two things:

1. Fork and clone the [vocabulary](https://github.com/sikaeducation/react-testing-vocabulary) repo and attempt to fill out as much of the sheet as you can.
2. Fork and clone the [Google Search Results](https://github.com/sikaeducation/google-search-results-react) exercise and get as far as you can.

It's OK if you can't get very far through either repo! You'll keep the vocabulary sheet updated throughout the workshop as you learn and refine, and the Google Search Results exercise helps me better understand where you're starting from.

## Standards

These are the skills we'll work toward in this workshop:

* [Build static pages using React](standards/build-static-pages-react)
* [Build dynamic pages using React](standards/build-dynamic-pages-react)
* [Build automated tests for React applications](standards/build-tests-react)
* [Integrate state management into a single-page application](standards/integrate-state-management-react)

Each standard has:

* Topic articles that support the skill
* Additional resources for each topic. Don't skip over these! The topic articles are focused and include the most important pieces of the topic, but the resources go into each in much more depth.
* Exercises for each topic
* Vocabulary for each topic
* A longer-form assessment for each skill

Everyone is starting from a different place so it's normal for everyone to end in a different place also. If you're new to React, you will likely get through the first standard and some of the second over the course of the workshop. If you're already experienced with React, you may be able to get through all 4 standards. Note that it's much more valuable to be able to confidently apply the concepts from one standard than it is to have a passing familiarity with all 4. Start at the beginning and be patient with yourself.

## Structure of the Workshop

This workshop is probably structured more loosely than other workshops you've been to. This is intentional. The fixed parts of the workshop look like this:

* 9am: Class starts, group warmups
* ~12pm: Lunch, one hour
* ~1pm: Group activity
* ~3:30pm: Live coding
* ~4:30pm: Daily survey and stand-down

What happens in between those times is variable and mostly determined by your collective skills and interest. The schedule should work for us rather than us trying to work around the schedule. Most days I'll try to do 2 or 3 group sessions. The rest of the time, you can work independently, work together in breakout rooms, or ask for code reviews or help. I'll do my best to get to everyone's requests by the end of the workshop.

## How to make the best use of this workshop

* If you're completely lost about where to start, [go here](standards/build-static-pages-react). Start at the first topic and move down the list. Your first goal is to be able to complete [Wineflix](https://github.com/sikaeducation/wineflix-react). If you already have some React experience, trying to finish this exercise is an appropriate place to begin.
* It's not important that you do answer every question or do every exercise in the curriculum. If you feel confident about the content, move on. That said, it's not possible to learn skills by reading about them. Make sure that you're actually writing code to lock concepts in.
* There is more content in this workshop than is possible for most people to complete in the time we have together. I'd much you confidently be able to do all of the skills in the Build Static Pages standard than be pretty rough on all 4 standards.
* Accept that it is not important to go to every live instruction session. Some of them will probably be too far behind you, some of them will be painfully ahead of you. It's usually a better use of your time to work independently on something than go to a session that's a poor fit. Also note that it's **not** rude to leave a session early if you realize this after it's started.
* Use the request form to advocate for yourself! Ask for any lessons you want to go to or questions you're curious about. You should be using this form throughout the day.
* The curriculum and lessons have lots of great content and exercises, but you'll grow the most from code reviews so don't be shy about asking for them. This goes double if you feel like your code is terrible or you're way behind everyone else.
* If you have specific needs or feedback that aren't being covered, use the daily survey. There's a Big survey at the end of the workshop that goes to Develop Intelligence, but the daily surveys are just for me to help steer the structure and content of our time together so that you get as much out of it as possible.
